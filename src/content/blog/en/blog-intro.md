So with this first post I don't want to really introduce myself because I already did that on the About Me section that you can look in the first page. I want to write what I really plan to do with this blog and why I created it. I don't except anyone to read since as I will mention later this is going to be like a learning diary. First let's jump on why I created this blog.

## Why I created this blog?

So being honest I created this mainly because the assigment I have in my TIC class (like a computer BASIC science). The assigment was to make a blog using wordpress or any other no code alternatives. But something that everyones who knows me as a developer knows, I am totally opposed to this platforms at least if you want to build real portfolios or websites. This is pretty obvious as right now I am a fully web developer so they kinda attempt to my work. As a result of this I asked my teacher to code the blog instead of using wordpress like my classmates, thankfully he accepted. This took me way more time than my classmates, but I hope the result is great enough. In addition to this I always wanted to create a portfolio for me, during the last 2 years I created a bunch of portfolios I never finished. So I took this opportunity to make it my portfolio too. I decided to code it with [astro](https://astro.build) because I just used astro once to build a small landing and I want to explore it more. And as a result of going with astro, if you do a lighthouse test here you will see al numbers in 90.

## What are my intentions with this blog?

So as I mentioned early what I want to make with this blog is to make as a learning diary. I don't want to do what probably all my classmates will do and throw this to the trash and forget it exists. I have always wanted to move to AI, and NO this is not related to the AI trend. AI was always my pationt for living since probably boston dynamics old videos. This trend is a part of the reason I want to start this journey now. The other reason is that during the last couples year where I have been coding webs and backends I didn't feel ready to jump to AI, and being realistic I wasn't. AI is based on tensors and I just studied 2d vectors last week (not the first time thought), you can think I am still not ready but I think I am and thats all I need. So answering finally the question, now i have a brand new PC capable of running the biggest open source models, so I started my journey to [learn AI with pytorch](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=DBrHbokYyTiHQJqc). I will be documenting all my learning throught this blog so it works as a notebook and a display of my progress and a reminder that I need to learn. Even I have planned some objectives for my journey.

## Objectives of the blog

I have some AI models that I want to train but I also want to write articles about certain topics too.

- [ ] Write about the BASIC AI concepts
- [ ] Start training basic models to solve mazes
- [ ] Talk about image generation models and what is the latent space.
- [ ] Talk about transformers and train a basic llm or finetune one.
- [ ] Talk about computer vision, and train a cat vs dog models.
- [ ] Talk about multimodality and train a model that knows the language with text input or image input (not ocr). Here I have a bet that the model will be able to difference Spanish/English from Arabic but not Spanish and English
- [ ] Talk about gaussian splatting

## How will be the blog written?

So maybe you are thinking this posts are going to be AI written. The answer is NO. I will write the blogs first in english. Then I will use AI to correct mistakes with the following [prompt]() that will keep all the content and just correct grammar and spelling mistakes. The previous version of each post before this correcting step will be available at github too. After the correction step I will manually translate each blog post to spanish. You can be thinking why tf he is going to translate it when he can use AI?. The answer is pretty easy, to practice my English and Spanish again + revising the topic I wrote about. So I will really remember what I learnt because first I learn on [the course](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=DBrHbokYyTiHQJqc), then I put it in practice, then I write about it in english, and then I translate to spanish.

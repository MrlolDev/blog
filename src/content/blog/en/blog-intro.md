So, with this first post, I don't want to introduce myself again because I already did that in the About Me section, which you can find on the first page. I want to write about what I really plan to do with this blog and why I created it. I don't expect anyone to read it since, as I will mention later, this is going to be like a learning diary. First, let's discuss why I created this blog.

## Why I created this blog?

Being honest, I created this mainly because of the assignment I have in my TIC class (like a computer BASIC science). The assignment was to make a blog using WordPress or any other no-code alternatives. But something that everyone who knows me as a developer knows is that I am totally opposed to these platforms, at least if you want to build real portfolios or websites. This is pretty obvious as right now, I am a full-fledged web developer, so they kind of impede my work. As a result of this, I asked my teacher to code the blog instead of using WordPress like my classmates. Thankfully, he accepted. This took me way more time than my classmates, but I hope the result is great enough. In addition to this, I always wanted to create a portfolio for myself. During the last 2 years, I created a bunch of portfolios I never finished. So I took this opportunity to make it my portfolio too. I decided to code it with [astro](https://astro.build) because I had just used Astro once to build a small landing, and I want to explore it more. And as a result of going with Astro, if you do a Lighthouse test here, you will see all numbers in 90.

## What are my intentions with this blog?

As I mentioned earlier, what I want to do with this blog is make it a learning diary. I don't want to do what probably all my classmates will do and throw this in the trash and forget it exists. I have always wanted to move to AI, and NO, this is not related to the AI trend. AI has always been my passion for living since probably Boston Dynamics' old videos. This trend is a part of the reason I want to start this journey now. The other reason is that during the last couple of years, where I have been coding websites and backends, I didn't feel ready to jump into AI, and being realistic, I wasn't. AI is based on tensors, and I just studied 2D vectors last week (not the first time though). You can think I am still not ready, but I think I am, and that's all I need. So, answering finally the question, now I have a brand new PC capable of running the biggest open-source models, so I started my journey to [learn AI with PyTorch](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=DBrHbokYyTiHQJqc). I will be documenting all my learning through this blog so it works as a notebook and a display of my progress and a reminder that I need to learn. Even I have planned some objectives for my journey.

## Objectives of the blog

I have some AI models that I want to train, but I also want to write articles about certain topics too.

- [ ] Write about the BASIC AI concepts
- [ ] Start training basic models to solve mazes
- [ ] Talk about image generation models and what the latent space is.
- [ ] Talk about transformers and train a basic language model or fine-tune one.
- [ ] Talk about computer vision and train a cat vs. dog model.
- [ ] Talk about multimodality and train a model that knows the language with text input or image input (not OCR). Here I have a bet that the model will be able to differentiate between Spanish/English from Arabic but not Spanish and English
- [ ] Talk about Gaussian splatting

## How will the blog be written?

So maybe you are thinking these posts are going to be AI-written. The answer is NO. I will write the blogs first in English. Then I will use AI to correct mistakes with the following [prompt](https://gist.github.com/MrlolDev/a717e6ddafb9dc67a671a0bb50ec3b40) that will keep all the content and just correct grammar and spelling mistakes. The previous version of each post before this correcting step will be available on GitHub too. After the correction step, I will manually translate each blog post to Spanish. You might be thinking, "Why is he going to translate it when he can use AI?" The answer is pretty easy: to practice my English and Spanish again + revising the topic I wrote about. So I will really remember what I learned because first, I learn on [the course](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=DBrHbokYyTiHQJqc), then I put it into practice, then I write about it in English, and then I translate it into Spanish. I will put at the end how many errors AI corrected.
